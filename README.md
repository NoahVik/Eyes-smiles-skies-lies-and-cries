# Eyes-smiles-skies-lies-and-cries

```
Up in skies there it lies
Where Gods playing since eternal times
Amidst pines peaks holding eternal skies
```
```
Where dawn's golden light still shines
Birds melodies ragas wakes ones eyes
Up there gods adorns walls tiles
```
```
Wild souls like bees out of hives
Seeking answers answered or unanswered which takes lives
```
```
East west without rest
Science silence all one tries
```
```
Maha Maya plays it's dice
Instance of ignorance tt trance of mind
```

```
Towards smoke and fragrance one flies
Puffs of smoke to skies comes and goes smiles
```
```
Nectar of divine is mine mind cries
Dark clouds now dawn on skies
```
```
Clouded minds dulled eyes
One more dip in drips of pleasures 
Just another chain in web of lies
```
```
Thunder shifts mind back to souls eyes
Out of trance be still silence the mind
Smoke settles incense reveals it's kind
```
```
Divine search gone upside
Down to ashes is karma held inside
```
```
Teared up are our eyes
Hear the souls cries 
Oh krishna signs among lies
```
```
Gods watch forefathers cries
Tears falls off from skies
Clears smoke of peaks and souls eyes
```
```
Clearer sight seeks new insight
Golden peak afar lights the sight
```
```
Melodies stories memories of past times
Day flies lost in eyes and smiles
```
```
Hard is way of still spine oh divine
Oh Krishna oh nachiketa way to certainity
Of eternity you saw is hard without signs
```

```
Time flying fear drawing
Hold on keep trying
```
```
Endure the tides
No tricks no slides
```
```
Eyes closed way ahead is even hidden
In shrooms n trips you say traumas will be ridden
```
```
Words smiles cries thoughts all the lies
Instance of ignorance trance of mind
```
```
See with divine eyes
Anger lies deception in you now shines
Only truth is way out of lies
Krishna your mercy tears eyes
```
