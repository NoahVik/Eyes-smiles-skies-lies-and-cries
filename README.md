# Eyes-smiles-skies-lies-and-cries


```
Up in skies there it lies
Where Gods playing since eternal times
Amidst Pines peaks holding eternal skies
```
```
Where dawn's golden light still shines
Birds melodies flutes wakes ones eyes
Up there gods adorn walls tiles
```
```
Wild souls like bees out of hives
Seeking answers which takes lives
East west without rest
Science silence yoga all one tries
```
```
Maha Maya spells eternal deciever of eyes
In a trance to smoke fragrance bee flies
Puffs of smoke to skies comes and goes smiles
Nectar of divine is mine mind cries
```
```
Dark clouds now dawn on skies
Clouded minds dulled eyes
One more dip in drips of pleasures 
Just another chain in web of lies
```
```
Thunder of skies takes mind back to soul's eyes
Be still till smoke merges up in skies
An mere incense enchanted my eyes
Years of karma to ashes tears eyes
```
```
Hear the souls cries 
Oh krishna signs among lies
```
```
Gods watch forefathers cries
Tears falls off from skies
Clears smoke of peaks and souls eyes
```
```
Eyes seek answers in eternal skies
Golden peak afar lights my eyes
Sign of eternity every soul desires
```
```
Melodies stories of gone by times
Day flies lost in eyes and smiles

Hard is way of still spine oh divine
```
```
Time flying fear drawing
Hold on keep trying 
Endure the tides
No tricks no slides
```
```
Hard even a step on way with closed eyes
And you say In shrooms n trips traumas dies
```
```
Words smiles cries all the lies
Instance of ignorance bee stuck in web of lies
```
```
Oh Krishna hard is way without signs
See with divine eyes
Reflect and see what eyes denies
Only truth is way out of lies
Krishna your mercy tears eyes
```
